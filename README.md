# 🧠 Voice-Controlled LLM Chatbot – By Ashutosh

This project is part of my 60-day AI learning challenge, where I aim to become one of the top 0.1% AI developers in the world. With just a basic understanding of Python and the help of AI (ChatGPT), I built this modular voice-powered chatbot using Together.ai APIs.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Chat with any LLM model (like Mistral or LLaMA) using Together.ai.
- ✅ Voice input-to-text (for natural conversations).
- ✅ Clean memory management: stores last 3 chats.
- ✅ Modular code: Easy to reuse in other AI tools or assistants.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to call LLM APIs (Together.ai) with POST requests.
- Python modular programming (splitting logic into files).
- Error handling, clean prompts, and secure `.env` usage.
- Using `strip()`, `split()`, and other powerful Python string methods.
- Developing real-world projects even as a beginner.

## 🔒 Security Note

Your `.env` file **must not be uploaded publicly**. Create it in this format:

```

TOGETHER\_API\_KEY=your\_actual\_api\_key\_here

## ▶️ Run the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
````

## ❤️ Final Note

This chatbot is a symbol of my journey — from a beginner to building functional AI tools in just a few weeks. I’m excited to learn more every day and help other jobless youth become creators too.
